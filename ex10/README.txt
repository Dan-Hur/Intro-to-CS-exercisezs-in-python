This is an "asteroids" game. To play, run "asteroids_main".
The programs that I myself wrote are : "asteroid", "asteroids_main", "ship" and "torpedo".
These include the inner logic of the game, and classes of objects used in the game.
The other files and programs were given by the course staff in order to visualize the asteroids game.
